07/20/2005 -- Balint Joo

	Version 1.14.4
	Various fixes:
	   -- memory manager singletons are now created with no destroy
	      policy. This fixes bug reported by CraigMcNeile in staggered
	      code where the static phases containing memory allocated by the
	      memory manager were destroyed after the memory manager causing
	      a dead reference exception

	   -- Fixed the PETE/Tools code so that it compiles. diff of 
	      QDPOperators.h before and after fix differs only in 
	      indentation. Rock on PETE!

	   -- Added transposeSpin function to QDPOperators.h 
	      and defined in qdp_primscalar.h qdp_primmatrix.h and 
	      most importantly in qdp_primspinmat.h. Incorrect
	      invocations eg transposeSpin(ColorMatrix) fail to compile.
	      Correct invocations work. transposeSpin(SpinMatrix) and 
	      transposeSpin(Propagator) were tested. Simple test code
	      t_transpose_spin added to examples directory -- now
	      need to move transpose spin functionality to appropriate
	      places in chroma.

        Version 1.0.0 considered ready. The arch  "scalar" and "parscalar"
	are considered working.

02/10/2003 -- George Fleming:

        Totally reworked the way QDP gets information about how to compile
        and link against QMP (if needed for parscalar).  INSTALL and README
        now are wrong and I need to update them.

01/29/2003 -- Robert Edwards:

        The single box (scalar) and parallel (parscalar) versions
        work. The old compile-time volume configuration removed. The
        user can now choose at run-time the lattice size.


12/13/2002 -- Balint Joo: 

	Switched to George Fleming style autoconf system (See INSTALL)
	examples now not automatically built (make check builds them)

	Added Robert's parscalar_specific.h of 12/12/2002
